LibUp config

Changes to releases.json should be picked up within 24-48 hours. Add whatever
library you want LibUp to upgrade and it'll get to it, hopefully. Follow
the format of the other entries in the file.

The canary repositories will go first, and once all of those are merged, it'll
start on the rest of the repositories.

It is YOUR responsibility to vet libraries being upgraded when you add them to
the list.
