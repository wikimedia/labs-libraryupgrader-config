LibUp config

Changes to releases.json should be picked up within 24-48 hours. Add whatever
library you want LibUp to upgrade and it'll get to it, hopefully.

It is YOUR responsibility to vet libraries being upgraded when you add them to
the list.

== releases.json ==

"version" is the internal LibUp config file schema.

"push" set this to false to immediately stop LibUp in cases of breakage or errors.

Each branch has its own object, and underneath that is the package managers. Each
library object can have the following settings:

"to" is the version string that LibUp should update the library to. This doesn't
have to be a single version, it could be a semver expression like: "^2.5 || ^3".

"weight" allows for having multiple updates happen in the same commit. LibUp will
only push a patch to Gerrit if it has a weight of at least 10, so if a package is
ready to be updated, but not critical enough to merit its own commit, you can set
the weight to 5 and LibUp will wait for another update to come along before pushing
the commit. This may be any integer value, but for simplicity it's recommended to
be either 5 or 10.

"skip" (optional) is a list of versions that should be skipped and not updated.
These are evaluated by using prefix matching (specifically Python's str.startswith).

== repositories.json ==

New repositories can be added in this file. Please try to make sure the "libraryupgrader"
Gerrit account has +2 permissions on these repositories (if possible).

The canary repositories will go first, and once all of those are merged, it'll
start on the rest of the repositories.

An entire namespace of repositories can be added by using a wildcard: `mediawiki/libs/*`.
